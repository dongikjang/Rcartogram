<h1>Rcartogram</h1>
<p align=right><a href="@TAR_FILE@">@TAR_FILE@</a></p>

This is an interface to <a
href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn">Mark Newmans</a> <a
href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/">cartogram code</a>,
and the technique of Newman and Gastner.  This is used to produce
spatial plots where the boundaries of regions can be transformed to be
proportional to density/counts/populations.  This is illustrated in
plots such as<center>
Mark Newman's plot of <b>People living with HIV/AIDS</b>
<br/>

</center> and <center>
Michael Gastner's Cartogram of the US House of Representatives
election, 2008 <br/>

</center>

<p>
The technique is described <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/20/7499">in a paper</a>.
</p>

<p> This is currently a basic (and quickly implemented) interface to
the cartogram code.  It does not do much to make this more
user-friendly for R users other than allowing one to call the
functionality in the C code and creating matrices, etc. out of the
results, providing a prediction method for mapping points on the grid
onto the resulting cartogram.  There are other things we can do with
this.  The current version doesn't even produce a plot!
So plenty for people to add and contribute.

<h2>Demo</h2>

We create a simple matrix (200 x 200) divided into 5 regions,
with a rotated circle (or square)  in the middle. Each of these regions has
a different (population) density.
We embed this in a bigger "sea" (300 x 300) and use cartogram()
to "fit" the diffusion transformation.
Then we superimpose the new regions.
The result is the following:

</center>

As we can see, the boundaries of the regions change
in a non-linear manner.  The top-right region
which has population density 400 expands into the adjacent
regions. The circular region has a higher population
and so its density is diffused over a larger area.
Note that it moves to accomodate the increased region in the
top-right corner. The other regions change in size
to equalize the population density.

<p>
The code is in the demo/ directory of the package and can be
run with <code>demo(synthetic, package = "Rcartogram")</code>.
Alternatively, you can look at the <a href="demo/synthetic.R">code here</a> and change
the settings, e.g. the size of the grid, whether to use
a circular region in the middle, the densities of the different
regions.
